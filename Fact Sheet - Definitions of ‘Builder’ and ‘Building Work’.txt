Work’ 
The Scheme  
The Work Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme 
(the Scheme) is established under the Federal 
Safety Commissioner Act 2022 (the Act) and is 
designed to improve Work, Health and Safety 
(WHS) in the building and construction industry.   
Subject to financial thresholds, only ‘builders’ who 
are accredited under the Scheme can enter into 
head contracts for building work that is funded 
directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth or a 
corporate Commonwealth entity.  
Definition of a ‘Builder’ 
The Act defines a builder, in relation to ‘building 
work’, as ‘a person who carries out any of the 
building work’. 
A project or contract manager, or developer who 
carries out ‘building work’ will be required to 
obtain accreditation in order to undertake projects 
covered by the Scheme.   
However, where a project manager, contract 
manager or developer is not carrying out building 
work, they will not require accreditation. In these 
circumstances, they will be required to engage an 
accredited builder to carry out the ‘building work’. 
Definition of ‘Building Work’ 
Building work for Scheme purposes means the: 
 construction 
 alteration 
 extension 
 restoration 
 repair 
 demolition 
 dismantling 
 
of any buildings, structures or works that form, or 
are to form, part of land, whether or not they are 
permanent. Any of these activities carried out on 
railways (not including rolling stock) and docks is 
also building work. 
 Building work is also any activities which involve 
the installation in any buildings, structures or 
works of fittings, including:  
 heating 
 lighting 
 air-conditioning 
 ventilation 
 power supply 
 drainage 
 sanitation 
 water supply 
 fire protection 
 security

Finally, building work is any operations to prepare, 
or to complete, any of the building activities listed 
above, including, for example: 
 
 site clearance 
 earth-moving 
 excavation 
 tunnelling 
 boring 
 laying of foundations 
 erection, maintenance and dismantling of 
scaffolding 
 on-site prefabrication of made-to-order 
components to form part of any building, 
structure or works 
 site restoration 
 landscaping 
 roadways and other access works 
What is not included as ‘Building Work’?
